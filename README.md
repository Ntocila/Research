## Introduction

During my study, I come across with different techniques and different tools for my individual project.
One thing that really got my attention is security. Today, it is really difficult to stay secured.
Using internet has many invulnerabilities and threats for users. During this research I will introduce Web application security,
explain common security terminology and present a set of proven security principles upon which many of the recommendations throughout this guide are based.
This research presents an overview of the security process and explains why a holistic approach to security that covers multiple layers including the network, host and application, is required to achieve the goal of hack-resilient Web applications. This chapter also introduces and defines host configuration categories and application vulnerability categories, which are used throughout the remainder of this guide.

## Summary
An increasing number of attacks target your application. They pass straight through your environment's front door using HTTP. The conventional fortress model and the reliance on firewall and host defenses are not sufficient when used in isolation. Securing your application involves applying security at three layers: the network layer, host layer, and the application layer. A secure network and host platform infrastructure is a must. Additionally, your applications must be designed and built using secure design and development guidelines following timeworn security principles.
