# Introduction
By some estimates, about 30 000 to 50 000 websites get hacked every day. The numbers are growing daily and the importance of website security is increasing rapidly.
Being secure in the online world becomes more and more important every day and it is vital to protect your website and the data it holds now.
In this article, we will give you five reasons why website security is important.

## Why Should a Website be Secure?
All websites are prone to get attacked anytime anywhere. This is true because cybercriminals do not have a specific website in mind when they plan to execute an attack. They use programs to automatically detect websites containing vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are used as points of entry to execute an attack on that particular website. Vulnerabilities present on your website can be dangerous as you may not even know about them. Your host will be able to inform you when your website has malware, but they may not inform you if you have vulnerabilities.

With the development of more sophisticated cyber threats, website security is gaining more importance as website owners are now keen on protecting their websites and visitors from dangerous cyber. As we all know, cybercrime is indeed a huge business and cybercriminals are always on the lookout for weaknesses in your website. Cyberattacks are mostly caused by malware that can:

- Steal data or traffic

- Crash or slow your website

- Make your website to be removed from search engine results

- Steal sensitive customer data, such as phone numbers or credit/debit card info

# Why Website Security is Important Today?
Website security is thus important to protect your business, brand, and reputation and also prevent financial loss and shutting down of your business website. You will be able to protect your reputation and retain customers and/visitors. You will find it difficult to identify malware and cyberattacks. Cybercriminals specialize in malware capable of subtly entering a website and staying hidden so that your website does not get infected and you may not even realize it. The reason for such malware attacks mostly includes cryptojacking, which mines websites for cryptocurrency without revealing any symptoms, and backdoors, one variety of malware that permits cybercriminals to access a website without the owner's knowledge.

### Hacked websites can target your customers
Malicious software is used to infect websites, gather data and in some cases even hijack computer resources.
A site where an attacker has gained access can be used to redirect traffic and infect visitors with malicious software.

It means that if your site is not protected, hackers can use your site to infect your site visitors with malware.
There are thousands of different types of malware and thousands of different ways to infect your website, which is mostly all done by automated hacking tools.
What they all have in common, is that the hacked websites are mostly used to retarget your potential customers, your website visitors.
### The number of hacked sites rises rapidly
What they all have in common, is that the hacked websites are mostly used to retarget your potential customers, your website visitors. Another reason why website security is important – to keep your customers safe.
A study was made that stated that there is an attack every 39 seconds on average on the web and the non-secure usernames and passwords that are being used give attackers more chance of success.
Just to be clear – an attack does not always mean something is hacked. For example, we see thousands of attacks targeted at the websites we protect every day.
In 2018 Google has sent over 45 million notifications to registered website owners through Search Console, alerting them to possible problems with their websites that could affect their appearance in a search.
Also, they sent 6 million manual action messages to webmasters about practices that were against Google’s guidelines, along with information on how to resolve the issues. And Google took action on nearly 90,000 user reports of search spam. 
### Business reputation loss and drop in revenue
There are over 1,5 billion websites on the world wide web today and people rely on search engines when they want to reach information on those sites.
Therefore search engine optimization is more important than ever and it is necessary for every webmaster to understand the true meaning of SEO as well as the potential it can provide for every business.
Google and other search engines (for who you typically don’t want to be on the naughty list) warn your customers and restrict them from entering your website. Lately, Google, for example, has stepped up the game even more.
Starting from July 2018, every website without SSL (HTTPS) will be marked as insecure and therefore receive an SEO penalty, which makes it harder for your company to reach new customers.
Google has released new details about its spam-fighting efforts, revealing that more than 80% of hacked sites have been detected and removed from search results. (source: Search Engine Journal)
But the reality is that, because of a hacked website, a customer loses trust, and therefore it will lead to company reputation loss, which for e-commerce can often mean an end of the business.
When talking about website security and CMS security the infections are also rising actively. For example, WordPress continues to be the leading infected website CMS.
On average, about 50 000 websites get hacked every day and in reality, the majority of these 50,000 sites are legitimate small businesses that are unwittingly distributing malicious code for cybercriminals.
When your site is hacked and added to different blacklists, the potential customer cannot reach the products or services being offered.
Anyways, if a potential customer visits your site and gets warned or infected, there is an extremely low chance that the customer will ever visit your site again.
### Learning from mistakes: website clean-up is more expensive than protection
As a website owner discovering that your website has been hacked, the first thing to do is to search “How to clean up a hacked site”. Yes, you will find a lot of blog posts and articles about it, but they will all eventually recommend you the same thing – have a professional to do it for you.

Performing a WordPress malware removal in a way that you can be sure that it’s clean is not an easy task. That’s why a service like this can cost over $150 per site and even then, depending on the service provider, you can’t be sure if the site was properly cleaned or not.
The latest research by Acunetix reveals that around 84% of websites contain vulnerabilities, which means all of them are prone to be infected at any time.
The process of a malware clean-up of a website more about knowing the vulnerabilities and knowing the way of a hacker’s mind. This is why we always recommend service providers who do manual clean-ups.
Malware is often hidden from the original files and the database and attackers put a lot of effort into making sure you won’t be able to remove their backdoors so easily.
It’s expensive, indeed. Not just the malware clean-up service itself, but the lost revenue and reputational damage are what can eat up a lot of time and money to recover from.
### So, why website security is important?
If your site is not protected, hackers can use your site to infect your site visitors with malware and steal the data your site holds.
